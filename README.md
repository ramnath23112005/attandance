📘 Attandance 
      A MERN-based academic scheduling and attendance platform

🛠️ Overview 
      Attandance is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). 
      It was designed to manage academic schedules and attendance records with modular clarity and analytical depth. 
      ⚙️ This is a retrospective project from my archive, built to sharpen my secondary skills in full-stack development. 
      My primary focus remains hardware systems and architecture.
